# hello-world
This repository is being created to help in practicing the GitHub Flow for the Data Analyst module.
I am relatively new in the coding industry, but hoping to continue to craft my skill and become more proficient and marketable. 
I've completed a 9-week full-stack program, done a 5-month paid internship with XCA through Humana, and completed a Web Development course though Code Louisville last year. 
I look forward to adding the skills that this module will bring.
